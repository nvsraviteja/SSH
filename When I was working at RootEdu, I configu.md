When I was working at RootEdu, I configured and deployed highly available and scalable applications on AWS using EC2, S3, Elastic Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling. I monitored these applications using the CloudWatch service to ensure system performance and reliability in cloud environments (AWS), maintaining high uptime and enabling quick issue resolution.

I implemented Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform, which improved efficiency by automating resource provisioning and reducing manual setup time by 40%. Additionally, I containerized applications using Docker to enable seamless deployment and scalability. I implemented a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, deploying Docker containers across multiple nodes and configuring them with an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

I work as a freelance web designer in my free time and have experience handling different types of customers.
